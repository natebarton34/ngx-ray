# NgX-Ray
A Playwright-Powered Visibility & Permission Analyzer for AngularJS Applications
---
NgX-Ray is a security and front-end observability tool that scans AngularJS applications for:
🔍 Hidden DOM elements (ng-hide, ng-if, ng-show, display:none, etc.)

🔑 AngularJS scope permission variables

🌐 Permission-like data in JSON network responses

---
And bundles them all into a:
🖥️ Tkinter interface with live search + tabbed results
---

This tool helps developers and security engineers understand what UI elements are suppressed and how permission logic propagates through the app—without needing access to source code.
