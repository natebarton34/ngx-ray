# NgX-Ray  
A Playwright-Powered Visibility & Permission Analyzer for AngularJS Applications

---

NgX-Ray is a diagnostic and observability tool designed to reveal hidden UI logic inside AngularJS applications — even when the source code isn’t available.

It performs three deep inspections:

**Hidden DOM element detection** (`ng-hide`, `ng-if`, `ng-show`, CSS visibility rules, etc.)  
**AngularJS scope permission extraction** (roles, permission flags, allow/can*, enabled states)  
**Network JSON permission mining** (server-side authorization indicators)

Then bundles all results into a clean, interactive:

**Tkinter desktop interface** with live search and organized tabs

This helps developers, testers, and security analysts understand how UI visibility, permissions, and authorization rules behave across dynamic AngularJS applications.

## Features

### DOM Hidden Element Scanner  
Detects UI elements that are hidden due to:

- AngularJS directives (`ng-hide`, `ng-if`, `ng-show`)  
- CSS-based invisibility  
- Native `[hidden]` attributes  
- Additional metadata (`id`, `classList`, `data-qa-id`, etc.)

### AngularJS Scope Permission Collector  
Recursively explores AngularJS scopes to uncover permission-related values such as:

- role variables  
- boolean permission flags  
- `"can*"` variables  
- allow/enabled fields  
- strings, numbers, and booleans stored in scope trees

### Network Response Permission Miner  
Intercepts JSON responses to extract authorization-related fields:

- `permissions`  
- `roles`  
- `canView`, `canEdit`, `allowed`, `enabled`, etc.

### Tkinter Desktop UI  
Provides an accessible interface with:

- Three structured tabs (DOM Hidden Elements, AngularJS Permissions, Network Permissions)  
- Live search across all tabs  
- Auto-formatted, grouped result sets  
- Automatic Chromium browser launch powered by Playwright
